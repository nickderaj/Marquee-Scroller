## Description

Simple scrolling text or images functionality to be easily copied into future projects, with some simple pixel art that I created of my dogs. Why bother doing this instead of just using the marquee functionality in HTML? <br>

<b>Deprecated</b><br>
This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

## Usage Information

Feel free to go through the code and copy it as you see fit. Just a simple marquee scroller to replace the deprecated function.
